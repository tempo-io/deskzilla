Store is implemented on the series of files, 1 index file and N data files.
Each data file contains blocks of equal size (say, 500 bytes) and stores only
data chunks of size lower than block size but higher than lower order file block
size.


Data File Structure:

StoreDataFile ::=
  FileHeader
  FreeBlockBitMask
  [ DataBlock ]*

FileHeader ::=
  Signature :0x5708EF12   { changed v2 }
  FileUID :UID
  HeaderLength :INT2 { including signature, but excluding CRC }
  DataBlockLength :INT4
  DataBlockCount :INT4
  FileVersion :CompactInt { since v2 }
  [ FileFeature ]*
  CRC

FreeBlockBitMask ::=
  BitMaskLengthInBytes :INT2 { usually 4096 bytes, excluding this field }
  Bits :ByteArray[BitMaskLengthInBytes] (actually bit array of 8*BitMaskLengthInBytes bits)

DataBlock ::=
  Signature :0xFFEEFFEF             { changed v2 }
  [ BlockFeature :CompactString ]*  { since v2 }
  null :CompactString               { since v2 }
  StorePath :CompactString
  DataLength :CompactInt { number of bytes that have meaning }
  Data :ByteArray [DataBlockLength - StorePath.Length - Signature.Length - DataLength.Size - CRC.Length]
  CRC

=======================

Index File Structure:

StoreIndexFile ::=
  FileHeader
  [ FileEntry ]*
  [ IndexEntry ]*
  CRC  { of all file - all file is written at one time }

FileHeader ::=
  Signature :0x5708E1EF       { changed v2 }
  FileUID :UID
  FileEntriesNumber :CompactInt
  IndexEntriesNumber :CompactInt

FileEntry ::=
  FileEntryMarker :'F'
  FileName :CompactChar
  LastSize :CompactInt
  LastMTime :CompactInt
  DataBlockSize :CompactInt
  FormatVersion :CompactInt   { since v2 }
  [ FileFeature ]*
  EndOfFeatures :'='

FileFeature ::=
  '+'
  FeatureName :CompactString

IndexEntry ::=
  IndexEntryMarker :'I'
  StorePath :CompactString
  FileID :CompactInt { in order of appearance of a file in this index }
  BlockID :CompactInt { in order of appearance of a block in the file }

CRC ::=
  CRCMarker :'C'
  CRC32 :INT4
