<!--
This document contains rules for auto-assign features. To configure
auto-assign, copy this file into "etc" subfolder of your workspace,
such as:
  C:\Documents and Settings\username\.Deskzilla\etc\autoAssign.xml

The auto-assign sequence contains rules. Each rule contains
a condition and a user. Auto-assign processor goes through all
rules from top to bottom, checking if the issue satisifies the
condition, and if it does, the user is selected as the new assignee.

Conditions are currently limited to "in" statements (like in this
sample) and their combinations with and/or. To write the formula
correctly, create the condition in query builder and copy-paste it
into text editor.
