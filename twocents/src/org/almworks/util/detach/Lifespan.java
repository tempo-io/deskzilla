/**
 * Lifespan is a period in the application's run time. At some point in time, lifespan ends.
 * <b>Lifespan owner</b> is someone who has a link to the implementation of lifespan. It is up to lifespan's owner
 * to decide when lifespan ends.
 * <b>Lifespan client</b> is someone who needs a lifespan. Usually it is someone who performs an "attach" operation and
 * needs to store "detach" operation somewhere.
 * <p>
 * This interface is used to ensure that object references such as listener lists get cleared when they are no longer
 * needed. A method that makes a subscription may require an instance of Lifespan to be passed as a parameter. This way
 * any programmer that is writing a method call gets the idea that a source-listener link is established and needs to
 * be cleared at some point in time.
 * <p>
 * After lifespan ends, any call to {@link #add} method will immediately call detach. It is advised to check that
 * the lifespan is not ended before adding, to produce less garbage. Example:
 * <pre>
 *   public void addListener(Lifespan lifespan, final Listener listener) {
 *     if (!lifespan.isEnded()) {
 *       myListeners.add(listener);
 *       lifespan.add(new Detach() {
 *         public void doDetach() {
 *           myListeners.remove(listener);
 *         }
 *       });
 *     }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <b>NB 1:</b> Lifespan's methods have no contractual obligations regarding threads.
 * It is up to lifespan owner and lifespan client to require or ensure thread safety.
 * <p>
 * <b>NB 2:</b> Parameter's {@link Detach#detach()} method may be called within {@link #add} method.
