 * An instance of Detach is a procedure that that disconnects objects in memory so they are possibly collected by GC.
 * <p/>
 * Detach happens only once. After {@link #detach} is called, all subsequent calls will be ignored. This is ensured
 * by thread-safe code. This class also makes sure that detach is not called concurrently or recursively.
 * <p/>
 * Before {@link #detach()} is called, any number of calls to preDetach() method may happen. See {@link #preDetach()}
 * for details.
 * <p/>
 * {@link #detach()} method will catch exceptions from the implementation of {@link #doDetach()} and log or rethrow them
 * according to {@link #onException} method. It is safe to place a call to detach into finally block.
 * <p/>
 * <b>NB:</b> When subclassing Detach, do not forget about implicit final fields in inner and anonymous classes!
