A simple way to disable the shortcut (option 4), would be to change

<!ENTITY quitApplicationCmd.key		"Q">
to
<!ENTITY quitApplicationCmd.key		"">

in

/xpfe/communicator/resources/locale/en-US/unix|win|os2/platformCommunicatorOverlay.dtd

(or
\chrome\en-win|unix.jar\locale\en-US\communicator-platform\platformCommunicatorOverlay.dtd
in the compiled version)

for every locale apart from mac, where this command seems to be the norm. At
least as a stopgap solution?

(Not that important, but it's inconvenient editing the jar file every time)
