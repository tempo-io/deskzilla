That's funny, you wrote 17 comments while Vaclav Dvorak wrote merely 3 and *he*
is the spammer...
Not to mention that for more than two years that this bug has been open, your
main contribution was to find every possible excuse to go on with this farce.
Vaclav's comments, on the other hand were meaningful and precisely to the point.

So many times have I (and others) lost data just because of this specific UI

unbelievable.

PLEASE, SHUT UP!
