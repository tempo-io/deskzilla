   * than has already succeeded may not get know (or be able to rollback) in case of other load part fails.<br>
   * On the other hand if some items are mistakenly locked due to exception the problem has time limited scope - when the
   * whole edit is done all items are released.

   * {@link com.almworks.items.sync.EditorFactory#prepareEdit(com.almworks.items.api.DBReader, EditPrepare)}
   * returns null then the whole inclusion is cancelled. To avoid cancel loader has to return not null result.
   * It is recommended to {@link com.almworks.items.sync.ItemEditor#STUB}. The {@link ItemEditor#onEditReleased()}
   * is called immediatly when loading done.
   * @return false means that inclusion of specified items surely can not be performed right now due to improper edit
   * state or due at least one item is already locked for another edit.
