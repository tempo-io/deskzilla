   <thetext>The message still does not convey why the document could not be opened. It
should read something like, &quot;File/home/faught/foo.gif is not of a supported
image type.&quot;

If the dialoge needs to be more generic for other implementations (such as being
called from the Open dialog), it could read &quot;/home/faught/foo.gif is not of a
supported file type.&quot; or one might want to consider giving it its own dialog so
it wouldn&apos;t need to be more generic.</thetext>
